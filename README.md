# MC Build Battle Tools
This is a collection of python scripts and tools I'm writing for my semi-regular(?) Build Battle events for [Coney Poney](https://discord.gg/coneyponey). These are designed for my personal use, and as such, are simple CLI scripts that interface over RCON, a communication protocol used by Minecraft for remote administration.
